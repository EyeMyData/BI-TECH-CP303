Project 1

### Introduction

Bike-share programs in urban cities are popping up all over the country. These systems allow people to rent bikes from stations for short-term use, then return the bikes to a station at their destination. Seattle recently installed [Pronto](https://www.prontocycleshare.com/) stations in locations all over the city, and Pronto wants to understand what factors predict a successful bike station. Use the methods you learned to help Pronto predict the best locations to install new bike-share stations.

### Data 

You have two files to work with, *usage_2012.tsv* and *stations.tsv*. The *usage_2012.tsv* file is large and contains each rental event as well as hourly weather data. The *stations.tsv* file contains geographical data about the stations like lat/long as well as counts of nearby amenities and road features.

### Instructions

Conduct an analysis using the techniques we've discussed as well as any others you think appropriate. You should discuss the rationale for applying the methods you chose, including a discussion of the assumptions you made, where the assumptions are violated, limitations of the analysis or data, and extensions for future work. Write a brief report (2 - 5 pages) of your analysis.

1. formalize the business problem as a data mining process
2. *define* the outcome(s) variables
3. use *aggregation* and *summaries* to create model inputs
4. report on performance

### Questions to think about

* What outcome are you modeling?
  * Rentals per hour?
  * Percent of bikes in use?
  * Rental duration?
* What will your output be?
  * You could provide a list of top 5 predictors of 
  * How will you define the 'success' or 'popularity' of a station?
* What other data sources could you pull into this dataset to improve your solution? Here's some links for inspiration:
  * [Open Street Map in R](http://osmar.r-forge.r-project.org/) 
  * [DC crime data](http://data.octo.dc.gov/metadata.aspx?id=3)

### Tips

* Remember that you're the quantitative expert and the client depends on you to help them make data-driven decisions.  It's *your* job to provide clarity and knowledge on the topic, and to present statistical arguments such that a non-techincal audience can understand your findings. 

* Although you might want to include figures and tables from an exploratory analysis, this is a report for your customer.  That means you should be labeling axes, titling figures and providing all the information necessary to understand your results, and no more.
