Project 1

### Introduction

Bike-share programs in urban areas are popping up all over the country. These systems allow people to rent bikes from stations for short-term use, then return the bikes to a station at their destination. Recently [Pronto](https://www.prontocycleshare.com/) stations have been installed in locations all over Seattle, and Pronto wants to understand what factors predict a successful bike station so they can expand operations. Use the methods you learned to help Pronto predict the best locations to install new bike-share stations.

### Data 

You have three files to work with, [*usage_2012.tsv*](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bi-tech-cp303/project+1/capital-bike-share/usage_2012.tsv), [*stations.tsv*](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bi-tech-cp303/project+1/capital-bike-share/stations.tsv) and [*weather*](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bi-tech-cp303/project+1/capital-bike-share/daily_weather.tsv). The *usage_2012.tsv* file contains each rental event. The *stations.tsv* file contains geographical data about the stations like lat/long as well as counts of nearby amenities and road features. Finally *weather.tsv* contains daily weather data.

Here's the structure of the three datasets:

Station data was retrieved from [Open Streetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.500/-0.100) with the R package [*osmar*](http://osmar.r-forge.r-project.org/). The weather data are normalized so that the measurements are between 0 and 1. Read more about the weather data [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

### Instructions

Conduct a predictive analysis that addresses the business problem using the techniques we've discussed as well as any others you think appropriate. You should discuss the rationale for applying the methods you chose, including a discussion of the assumptions you made, where the assumptions are violated, limitations of the analysis or data, and extensions for future work. Write a brief report (2 - 6 pages) of your analysis. Be succinct, but don't leave out any details you think are important.

1. formalize the business problem as a data mining process
2. *define* the outcome(s) variables
3. use *aggregation* and *summaries* to create model inputs
4. report on the performance of your final model

Sections you'll probably want to include in your report are an introduction to the business problem and brief description of the data, methods, results, and discussion. I've provided [an example report](https://github.com/erinshellman/BI-TECH-CP303/blob/master/projects/project%201/example_project.pdf) from a capstone course I took as a masters student that roughly outlines what you should aim for in your reports. No laughing please!

### Questions to think about

* What outcome are you modeling?
  * Rentals per hour?
  * Percent of bikes in use?
  * Rental duration?
  * Number of registered users?
* What will your output be?
  * You could provide a list of top 5 predictors of 
  * How will you define the 'success' or 'popularity' of a station?
* What other data sources could you pull into this dataset to improve your solution? Here's some links for inspiration:
  * [Open Street Map in R](http://osmar.r-forge.r-project.org/) 
  * [DC crime data](http://data.octo.dc.gov/metadata.aspx?id=3)

### Tips

* Remember that you're the quantitative expert and the client depends on you to help them make data-driven decisions.  It's *your* job to provide clarity and knowledge on the topic, and to present statistical arguments such that a non-techincal audience can understand your findings. 

* Although you might want to include figures and tables from an exploratory analysis, this is a report for your customer.  That means you should be labeling axes, titling figures and providing all the information necessary to understand your results, and no more.
