> Welcome to data mining! This is an applied course, meant to teach you practical tools for data mining and knowledge discovery.  The course is composed of four units: regression, classification, unsupervised learning and time series analysis.  The goal is to provide experience in a breadth of applications and to prepare you for the job of an analyst, data scientist, or any role that calls for data mining.  If you already have experience with R or data mining, there are additional readings and challenges in the projects for you to elevate your skills.

## Course Grade

Grading is based on classroom participation, completion of homeworks and projects, and attendance. Students are required to attend 80% of the lectures to receive a passing grade.

#### Due Dates

You will have two weeks to complete projects.

| Assignment |   Date   |
|-----------|----------|
| Project 1 | April 27 | 
| Project 1 Critiques | May 4 | 
| Project 2 | May 11   | 
| Project 2 Critiques | May 18 | 
| Project 3 | June 1   | 
| Project 3 Critiques | June June 8 | 
| Project 4 | June 15  |

## Policies and values

A large component of this course is providing critical feedback on the analys

## Assignments

#### Projects

There are a total of four projects, one for each topic area.  For each project you will receive a business need and a corresponding data set.  You're free to use any method 

#### Critiques

On the days that you turn in your project reports, you will receive the reports of three of your classmates.  The following week read their reports and provide thoughts and feedback.  Please write at least a paragraph and remember to talk about things you liked.  While you're reading, try to put yourself into the mind of the business stakeholder and ask if your requests were adequately met.  Are you confident in the result?  Were the figures and supporting evidence compelling?  Remember to maintain a tone of mutal respect and read the section on policies and values for more information.

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course.  Everything you need to suceed is available in the course repository.  If you want different perspectives on the material, I recommend the following texts:

*Calculus, Concepts and Contexts* by James Stewart, 4th edition. (Required)

## Topics 

This is fluid and could change.

Week | Date | Topic | Dataset
-------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------
1 | April 6 | Introduction to Data mining and programming with R. | TBD
2 | April 13 | Linear regression | BikeShare 
3 | April 20 | Linear regression extensions | BikeShare 
4 | April 27 | Logistic regression | Twitter? Is it a bot?
5 | May 4 | Trees | Twitter? 
6 | May 11 | Association rules | The Million Song Dataset
7 | May 18 | Clustering | The Million Song Dataset 
8 | June 1 | Time series I | TBD 
9 | June 8 | Time series II | TBD
10 | June 15 | Final | None! 

## Software Installation

We'll be using that statistical programming language R for this course.  In addition, I highly recommend using the R Studio, an R interactive development environment (IDE).  Please have R and R studio install on your machine before the first day of class to create more time for course content.
